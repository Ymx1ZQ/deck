# DEVPLAN — `deck` skill

## Goal

Build a Claude Code skill named `deck` exposing three subcommands (`brief`, `draft`, `render`) via runtime routing. Each subcommand produces a file artifact that feeds the next one, forming a pipeline:

```
presentation-brief.md  →  presentation.md  →  presentation.html + presentation.pdf
```

The skill packages **three things** that today live only in the head of someone who already knows how to make a deck and how to wrestle md2 into producing print-clean PDFs:

1. **Slide-pattern library** (12+ patterns with copy-paste md2 syntax).
2. **Copywriting rules** that make a business deck land (headline-first, parallel bullets, concrete numbers, no filler).
3. **Print-aware constraints** that prevent the recurring bugs we hit when rendering md2 to PDF: charts with extreme value ratios truncating labels, too much text alongside a chart pushing it to the next page, empty/half-filled slides, pie chart sizing.

Ship with a local installer modelled on `landing/install.sh` (same local/remote detection, same `--force` / `--help` flags). Tests follow the `landing/tests/` pattern (bash + grep contract checks).

## Non-goals (v0.1)

- Online raw-install hosting — structure compatible, not implemented.
- Symlink-based install.
- Visual self-review loop (render PDF → re-read → fix overflow). Documented as a v0.2 idea.
- Multi-document branding — one palette per run.
- Brand asset ingestion (logo extraction, palette auto-detect from URL/PDF).
- Image generation. Users embed their own images via `![](path)` or `<img>`.
- Translation pipeline — language is user-driven mid-session.
- Automatic data-source ingestion (e.g. read a CSV → propose a chart). User pastes data inline.

```

Naming rationale:
- `prompt.md` per subcommand = the instructions Claude reads after routing (mirrors `landing`).
- Knowledge files in `draft/` keep short domain names (`slide-patterns.md`, `copy-rules.md`, etc.) — the subcommand prompt loads them lazily as needed.
- `render.sh` is a separate executable so we can also call it manually from the shell, decoupled from Claude.

## Artifact pipeline

All artifacts land in the user's current working directory (CWD) with fixed filenames:

| Subcommand     | Reads (CWD)                       | Writes (CWD)                                |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `/deck brief`  | user interview                    | `presentation-brief.md`                     |
| `/deck draft`  | `presentation-brief.md`           | `presentation.md`                           |
| `/deck render` | `presentation.md`                 | `presentation.html` + `presentation.pdf`    |

If the expected input file is missing in CWD, the subcommand:
1. Tells the user it needs `<filename>`.
2. Offers two paths: (a) run the previous subcommand first, or (b) paste/point to the input inline.
3. Does not silently invent content.

## Runtime behavior

`SKILL.md` frontmatter declares name + description (trigger). Body contains:

1. **Language rules** (global):
   - Chat: always reply in the user's language.
   - Artifacts: English by default. Ask once per session *"Artifact language? (default: English)"* unless the user has already specified. User can override any time mid-session.

2. **Routing table** — reads the argument after `/deck`:
   - `brief` → read `brief/prompt.md`.
   - `draft` → read `draft/prompt.md`, then lazy-load `draft/slide-patterns.md`, `draft/copy-rules.md`, `draft/md2-cheatsheet.md`, `draft/print-constraints.md` as referenced.
   - `render` → read `render/prompt.md`, invoke `render/render.sh`.
   - no arg / unknown arg → 3-line menu.

3. **Subcommand isolation** — each branch reads only its own folder (the `draft/` knowledge files are loaded only when in the `draft` branch).

## Framework: what the skill bakes in (the value-add)

### Slide patterns (`draft/slide-patterns.md`)

The skill ships a curated catalog. Each pattern documents:
- Name + when to use.
- md2 syntax block (copy-paste ready).
- Anti-patterns (when NOT to use).

Initial set (v0.1):

1. **Cover** — H1 + 1-2 lines (presenter, date, context).
2. **Section divider** — slide with only H2, big and centered.
3. **Hero stat** — H2 takeaway + single big number (`# 50%` inside slide) + 1 framing sentence.
4. **Bullet list** — H2 + 3-5 bullets with selective `**bold**`.
5. **Two-column compare** — `:::columns` with `:::col` × 2 (vs / before-after / problem-solution).
6. **Quote / testimonial** — H2 + `> blockquote` + attribution.
7. **Process / steps** — H2 + numbered list `1. 2. 3.`.
8. **Timeline** — H2 + table OR `:::columns` with date/event pairs.
9. **Single chart** — H2 + 1-line context + `:::chart`.
10. **Table** — H2 + table + optional `> takeaway` blockquote.
11. **Diagram / image** — H2 + `![](path)`.
12. **People / team** — H2 + `:::columns` with photo + bio per col.
13. **Closing / CTA** — H2 + 2-3 next-step bullets + contacts.

### Copywriting rules (`draft/copy-rules.md`)

- **Headline = punchline**: the slide's `## H2` must state the takeaway, not the topic. *"Mercato IA cresce +50% YoY"* > *"Dati di mercato"*.
- **Pyramid principle**: top of the deck states the conclusion; the rest proves it.
- **One idea per slide** (test: "if this were the only slide, what would the audience remember?").
- **Numbers > adjectives**: *"+50% YoY"* > *"crescita esplosiva"*.
- **Inline source citations** where credibility matters: *"+50% YoY (Osservatorio AI PoliMI 2025)"*.
- **6x6 rule** as a ceiling, not a target — max 6 bullets × 6 words per bullet.
- **Parallel bullets**: same verb tense, same length, same shape.
- **Banned phrases**: *"in conclusione"*, *"come abbiamo visto"*, *"vorrei sottolineare"*, *"è importante notare"*. They are filler that signals lack of confidence.

### md2 cheatsheet (`draft/md2-cheatsheet.md`)

Compact reference — the skill never has to fetch md2's README:
- Frontmatter (`+++` block, fields: `title`, `palette`, `colors`, `lang`, `dark`).
- Built-in palettes (`default`, `warm`, `cool`, `mono`, `vivid`, `pastel`).
- `:::chart TYPE [--options]` syntax with all 5 chart types.
- `:::columns` / `:::col` layout.
- Heading levels (H1 cover, H2 slide title, H3/H4 sub-sections).
- Footnotes, blockquotes, fenced code blocks.
- Inline HTML allowed (iframes for embeds, `<img>`).

### Print constraints (`draft/print-constraints.md`)

The bug catalog we hit while iterating on the Puglia deck:

- **One chart per slide**. Charts have `break-inside: avoid` in print CSS — combining a chart with a long text block pushes the chart to a new page.
- **Description text alongside a chart: max 1-2 short lines** (≈ 30-50 words). Above that the chart spills.
- **Pie chart**: 50vh tall + horizontal legend = barely fits a print page on its own. Description must be ≤ 1 line. Prefer pie only when the slice ratios actually carry the message (otherwise use a bar/column).
- **Bar / column charts: avoid value ratios > 10x in a single chart**. The smallest bar's data label gets clipped/truncated (e.g. "350" rendered vertically as "3 5 0" when the largest is "50000"). Either split the chart, switch to percentages, or drop the smallest value to text.
- **Tables can carry more text + a `> takeaway` blockquote** (2 lines max) without spilling.
- **Avoid empty slides**: if a section has < 30 words or 1 short bullet, fold it into the previous or next slide.
- **Section dividers are exempt** from the "no empty slide" rule — they're intentional pauses.
- **Always `## H2` per slide** — md2 falls back to "Slide N" otherwise, breaking the sidebar nav.

## Render pipeline (`render/render.sh`)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

INPUT="${1:?Usage: render.sh <input.md>}"
[ -f "$INPUT" ] || { echo "File not found: $INPUT" >&2; exit 1; }

HTML="${INPUT%.md}.html"
PDF="${INPUT%.md}.pdf"

# Step 1: md → HTML via md2
command -v md2 >/dev/null || { echo "md2 not on PATH" >&2; exit 2; }
md2 "$INPUT"

# Step 2: HTML → PDF via Chromium-family headless
BROWSER=""
for cmd in chromium google-chrome chrome chromium-browser; do
  if command -v "$cmd" >/dev/null; then BROWSER="$cmd"; break; fi
done
[ -n "$BROWSER" ] || { echo "Need chromium/google-chrome on PATH" >&2; exit 3; }

"$BROWSER" --headless --disable-gpu --no-sandbox \
  --print-to-pdf-no-header \
  --print-to-pdf="$PDF" \
  "file://$(realpath "$HTML")" 2>/dev/null

echo "Generated: $HTML"
echo "Generated: $PDF"
```

## Milestones

### M1 — Scaffold directory structure ✅

- [x] Create `skill/` with subfolders `brief/`, `draft/`, `render/`.
- [x] Create empty placeholder files per the layout.
- [x] Create `tests/` directory.
- [x] Create `.gitignore`, `install.sh` (placeholder), `README.md`, `DEVPLAN.md`.
- [x] Verify tree matches.

Note: no git remote configured — commits stay local. User can add a remote later.

### M2 — `SKILL.md` (routing + language rules + prerequisites) ✅

- [x] Frontmatter: `name: deck`, `description: <trigger covering brief/draft/render pipeline + business deck context>`.
- [x] Frontmatter: `compatibility: Requires md2 (markdown→HTML presentation converter) and a Chromium-family browser (chromium, google-chrome, chrome) on $PATH` — per [agentskills.io spec](https://agentskills.io/specification#compatibility-field) (max 500 char).
- [x] Body: `## Prerequisites` section with concrete install hints for both `md2` and a Chromium-family browser, and a pointer to README.md → Requirements for the long form.
- [x] Language rules block.
- [x] Routing table with 3 branches + menu fallback.
- [x] Note on artifact pipeline (input filename expected in CWD per step).
- [x] Subcommand isolation rule (draft knowledge files load lazily inside the draft branch).
- [x] Keep short — heavy content lives in subcommand prompts.

### M3 — `brief/prompt.md` ✅

- [x] Interview script with these required sections:
  - **Audience**: who's in the room? what do they already know? what do they care about?
  - **Objective**: decision to take, action to ask for, awareness to build, learning to share.
  - **Format**: live deck (presented), leave-behind (read alone), or hybrid? affects density per slide.
  - **Length budget**: target slide count or time slot.
  - **Brand**: palette (built-in or custom), logo if any, language for artifact.
  - **Hard content**: data, claims, quotes the user wants in. Sources for credibility.
  - **Tone**: formal/casual/punchy?
- [x] Output template: `presentation-brief.md` with structured sections matching the interview.
- [x] Filename enforcement: must write `presentation-brief.md` to CWD.
- [x] Delegate language to `SKILL.md`.

### M4 — `draft/` knowledge files ✅

- [x] `slide-patterns.md`: write the catalog of 13 patterns documented above. Each pattern has: name, when to use, md2 syntax block, anti-pattern note.
- [x] `copy-rules.md`: write the rule list documented above. Examples (good vs bad) for each rule.
- [x] `md2-cheatsheet.md`: distilled reference (frontmatter, palettes, charts, columns, headings, footnotes, inline HTML).
- [x] `print-constraints.md`: write the bug catalog with concrete numbers (≤ 50 words next to a chart, value ratios ≤ 10x, etc.).

### M5 — `draft/prompt.md` (writer) ✅

- [x] Reads `presentation-brief.md` from CWD; if missing, offers to run `/deck brief` or accept inline content.
- [x] Walks user through content gathering only for the gaps the brief left open.
- [x] Proposes a narrative arc — chooses among Pyramid / SCQA / 3-act based on the brief's objective; presents the arc as a 1-line outline before writing.
- [x] Maps each beat to a slide pattern from `slide-patterns.md`.
- [x] Writes md2 markdown to `presentation.md` in CWD, applying:
  - The pattern syntax from `slide-patterns.md`.
  - Copy rules from `copy-rules.md`.
  - Print constraints from `print-constraints.md`.
  - Frontmatter palette from the brief.
- [x] Lazy-load knowledge files (read each one only when it becomes relevant in the conversation).
- [x] Delegate language to `SKILL.md`.

### M6 — `render/` (script + prompt) ✅

- [x] `render.sh`: write the pipeline script documented above. Make executable.
- [x] `render.sh`: handle missing `md2`, missing browser, missing input file with clear errors.
- [x] `render.sh`: support `--no-pdf` flag to skip PDF generation if user only wants HTML.
- [x] `prompt.md`: instructs Claude to invoke `~/.claude/skills/deck/render/render.sh <presentation.md>`; on error, surface the message; on success, report both file paths to the user.
- [x] **Bonus**: `render.sh` falls back to `firefox` if no Chromium-family browser is available (Firefox 102+ supports `--headless --print-to-pdf`). Chromium-family is preferred for higher CSS fidelity.

Note: on the dev machine the user's Firefox is installed via snap and has missing shared-object dependencies, so the live PDF generation hangs. The script is spec-correct; installing chromium (`apt install chromium-browser`) is the recommended fix and is documented in README → Requirements.

### M7 — `install.sh` + `README.md` polish ✅

- [x] Adapt `landing/install.sh` to a single-target install: source `skill/` → dest `~/.claude/skills/deck/`.
- [x] Keep local/remote detection, `--force`, `--help`.
- [x] Add **dependency check** (UX layer, not part of the agentskills.io standard): probe `md2` on `$PATH`; probe `chromium` / `google-chrome` / `chromium-browser` / `chrome` / `firefox`. If anything is missing, print the install hints and ask `Continue installing? [y/N]` (soft-fail so CI / build environments aren't blocked).
- [x] Print post-install summary with the three `/deck <cmd>` invocations and the pipeline order.
- [x] `README.md`: concrete install commands for `md2` and the browser; cross-references the SKILL.md `compatibility` field.

### M8 — Tests ✅

Note: in TDD mode, each test file was written BEFORE the corresponding implementation milestone (M2-M7). M8 ships only the aggregator and the optional `skills-ref` validation hook.

- [x] `tests/test_structure.sh`: filesystem checks (every required file exists and is non-empty). Written in M2.
- [x] `tests/test_skill.sh`: SKILL.md frontmatter (`name: deck`, non-empty description, `compatibility:` present and ≤500 char per agentskills.io spec), routing references all 3 subcommands, mentions all 3 artifact filenames, references CWD, body has `## Prerequisites` section. Written in M2.
- [x] `tests/test_skill.sh`: optionally, if `skills-ref` is on `$PATH`, run `skills-ref validate skill/` and assert green. Skip cleanly if not installed.
- [x] `tests/test_brief.sh`: brief/prompt.md mentions audience, objective, format, length, brand, language; declares output filename `presentation-brief.md`. Written in M3.
- [x] `tests/test_draft.sh`: draft/prompt.md references slide-patterns.md, copy-rules.md, md2-cheatsheet.md, print-constraints.md; each knowledge file contains its core invariants. Written in M4-M5.
- [x] `tests/test_render.sh`: render.sh has `set -euo pipefail`, handles missing `md2`, handles missing browser, accepts a `.md` argument, supports `--no-pdf`. Written in M6.
- [x] `tests/test_install.sh`: install.sh handles `--force`, `--help`, copies `skill/` to `~/.claude/skills/deck/`; dependency probes work. Written in M7.
- [x] `tests/test_all.sh`: runs all the above and aggregates pass/fail counts.

### M9 — Smoke test ✅ (automated portion)

- [x] `bash install.sh --force` → `~/.claude/skills/deck/` populated with SKILL.md + all subcommand files (verified: SKILL.md, brief/prompt.md, draft/{prompt,slide-patterns,copy-rules,md2-cheatsheet,print-constraints}.md, render/{prompt.md,render.sh}). render.sh remains executable post-copy.
- [x] `bash tests/test_all.sh` → 6 suites green, all assertions pass.
- [x] Skill registered: appears in the Claude Code available-skills list under name `deck` after install.
- [ ] **Manual smoke (user-side)**: in a fresh test CWD, run `/deck brief`, then `/deck draft`, then `/deck render`. Open the resulting PDF. Verify: no empty slides, no spilled charts, no truncated labels. Cannot run automatically — requires interactive Claude Code session.
- [ ] **Regression smoke**: re-render `/home/ymx1zq/Documents/tecnonidi-vemove/ricerca-target-puglia.md` through `~/.claude/skills/deck/render/render.sh`. HTML generation works; PDF generation requires installing chromium (`apt install chromium-browser`) since the dev machine's snap-Firefox has missing shared-object dependencies.

## Backlog (no version assigned yet)

- **Visual self-review loop**: after `/deck render`, optionally let Claude read the PDF, detect empty slides / clipped chart labels / overflows, propose targeted edits to `presentation.md`.
- **Brand ingestion**: extract palette from a logo file or a URL screenshot.
- **Custom palette wizard**: `/deck palette` to create `~/.md2/palettes/<brand>.toml` interactively.
- **Multi-deck**: same brief, different audiences (sales vs board vs investor) → multiple decks in one run.
- **Versioning / update detection** in installer.

---

# v0.2 milestones

User feedback after v0.1 ship surfaced two issues:
1. **No orientation control.** The first deck rendered portrait by default; the user wanted landscape (16:9 standard for slides). md2 has no orientation flag, so we have to control it via `@page` CSS at render time.
2. **Agent improvises the render step.** When `/deck render` ran, the agent occasionally bypassed the bundled `render.sh` and tried alternative tools (e.g. playwright) or assembled its own md2 + browser invocation chain, sometimes hitting errors. The render prompt needs to be strictly prescriptive.

v0.2 also folds in a Gotchas section to prevent the most common md2 syntax mistakes (frontmatter delimiter confusion, chart formatting) and a self-validation step that catches them before the file is handed off.

## v0.2 file changes

```
skill/
├── brief/prompt.md            # +Orientation, +Paper size questions; output template extends Format
├── draft/
│   ├── prompt.md              # +Gotchas section; +self-validation step (run md2, fix on error, retry once)
│   ├── md2-cheatsheet.md      # +note on `+++` (TOML) vs `---` (YAML) confusion
│   └── slide-patterns.md      # (no change)
└── render/
    ├── prompt.md              # Hard rules: invoke ONLY render.sh; no playwright/weasyprint/pandoc/etc.
    └── render.sh              # +--landscape/--portrait flags, +--paper A4|letter, +CSS injection for @page
```

`presentation.md` produced by `/deck draft` carries the orientation as an HTML comment so re-renders are deterministic:

```markdown
<!-- deck-orientation: landscape -->
<!-- deck-paper: A4 -->
+++
title = "..."
+++

# ...
```

`render.sh` parses these comments before invoking the browser; CLI flags override.

## Milestones

### M10 — Orientation + paper size support ✅

- [x] **brief/prompt.md**: add to the interview, in `Format` section: orientation (landscape default), paper size (A4 default).
- [x] **brief/prompt.md**: extend the output template under `## Format` with `Orientation:` and `Paper size:` fields.
- [x] **draft/prompt.md**: emit `<!-- deck-orientation: ... -->` and `<!-- deck-paper: ... -->` HTML comments at the very top of `presentation.md` (before the `+++` frontmatter).
- [x] **render/render.sh**: CLI flags `--landscape` / `--portrait` / `--paper A4|letter`; `--help` updated.
- [x] **render/render.sh**: parses HTML comments from input md when no CLI flag set; defaults landscape A4.
- [x] **render/render.sh**: after `md2`, injects `<style>@page { size: <paper> <orientation>; margin: 12mm; }</style>` before `</head>` via `sed`.
- [x] **tests/test_brief.sh**: covers orientation/landscape/portrait/paper/A4 patterns.
- [x] **tests/test_draft.sh**: covers `deck-orientation` / `deck-paper` emission.
- [x] **tests/test_render.sh**: covers CLI flags + behavioral check that generated HTML contains `@page A4 landscape`, `@page letter portrait`, CLI override, default-when-no-comments. 4 behavioral cases all green.

### M11 — Tighter `render/prompt.md` to prevent agent improvisation ✅

- [x] **render/prompt.md** — added "Hard rules" section with explicit Do / Do not lists; forbids playwright, puppeteer, weasyprint, pandoc, wkhtmltopdf, custom Python/Node wrappers, direct invocation of md2/chromium/firefox, and reading HTML during render.
- [x] **render/prompt.md** — exit-code table preserved; cross-linked.
- [x] **render/prompt.md** — top-of-file directive: *"This subcommand has exactly one job: invoke the bundled render.sh and report. Do not improvise. Do not invent an alternative pipeline."*
- [x] **tests/test_render.sh** — asserts the forbidden-tool list, the exact invocation pattern, and the no-improvise directive. 6 new assertions, all green.

### M12 — Gotchas + self-validation in `draft/prompt.md`

- [ ] **draft/prompt.md** — add a `## Gotchas (md2 syntax pitfalls)` section listing concrete mistakes:
  - md2 frontmatter uses `+++` (TOML), NOT `---` (YAML — that's the Claude SKILL.md convention; do not mix them).
  - Slide separator `---` MUST have a blank line above and below. Without them md2 keeps appending to the current slide silently.
  - `:::chart` / `:::columns` blocks need a blank line above and below; the closing `:::` is on its own line.
  - Tables inside `:::chart` must have a header row, a separator row (`|---|---|`), and at least 2 data rows — single-row charts render badly.
  - Pie chart values must be positive integers; zero or negative slices crash the renderer.
  - All table rows must have the same number of `|` columns as the header — mismatched columns produce silent fallback to plain text.
  - Don't nest `:::chart` inside `:::columns` — the parser doesn't handle nested directives reliably.
- [ ] **draft/prompt.md** — add a `## Self-validation (before declaring done)` step at the end:
  1. After writing `presentation.md`, run `md2 presentation.md` once via Bash.
  2. If md2 errors out, read the error, fix the offending block, and re-run. Maximum 2 retries.
  3. If md2 still fails after 2 retries, surface the error to the user verbatim and ask which block to drop.
  4. On success, the slide count in the generated HTML must match the slide count intended in the outline. If it doesn't, a `---` separator is missing or has no blank line.
- [ ] **md2-cheatsheet.md** — add a small callout at the top: *"md2 frontmatter is `+++` (TOML), NOT `---` (YAML). The `---` is the slide separator."*
- [ ] **tests/test_draft.sh** — assert prompt mentions "Gotchas" with the `+++` vs `---` warning; assert prompt mentions running md2 as self-validation.

### M13 — v0.2 smoke + ship

- [ ] `bash install.sh --force` — re-install on top of v0.1.
- [ ] `bash tests/test_all.sh` — all suites green.
- [ ] **Manual regression**: re-render `/home/ymx1zq/Documents/tecnonidi-vemove/ricerca-target-puglia.md` (or a fresh deck) with default settings → confirm landscape orientation in the PDF.
- [ ] **Manual regression**: render the same deck with `--portrait` → confirm orientation flips.
- [ ] **Manual regression**: introduce a deliberate md2 syntax error in a draft → confirm draft/prompt.md catches it via self-validation and fixes it.
- [ ] Update README.md mentioning the new flags and the orientation behaviour.
- [ ] Tag and push.
